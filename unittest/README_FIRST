IMPORTANT!!

The tests must be run in a specific order to insure that dependencies are met!

To make this work you should make use of the qbunit.xml configuration file.

call:

../composer/vendors/bin/phpunit --configuration s3c3unit.xml

This also means that in order to add new tests to the suite they must be added
to the s3c3unit.xml file somewhere after the SetupTest.php.
