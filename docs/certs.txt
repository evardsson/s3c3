To generate a key (not a cert) from the command line:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out key_name_tmp.pem 2048
put in passphrase, required by openssl

to strip passphrase:
openssl rsa -in key_name_tmp.pem -out key_name.pem -days 365
rm key_name_tmp.pem

Naming:

The naming of keys and certificates in S3C3 is important:

For server keys & certificates (sxn = S3C3 Scheme Server/Pool Name):

sxn.pem
sxn.crt

For client keys & certificates (sxn = S3C3 Scheme Server/Pool Name, # = server number in the pool, for single-server pools this will be 1):
sxn#_client.pem
sxn#_client.crt


In the certificate store each server will have:
/path/to/certificate_store/
    sxn.pem - the server/pool private key
    sxn.crt - the server/pool public cert
    sxn#_client.pem - the local machine's private client key
    sxn#_client.crt - the local machine's publib client cert
    
SO - consider the following scheme:

Server pool - S3C3 Scheme Name: polo, number of servers: 5
Server      - S3C3 Scheme Name: gold, number of servers: 1
Server      - S3C3 Scheme Name: mac,  number of servers: 1

On the first server in pool "polo":
certificate_store/
    polo.pem
    polo1_client.pem

    polo.crt
    gold.crt
    mac.crt
    polo1_client.crt
    polo2_client.crt
    polo3_client.crt
    polo4_client.crt
    polo5_client.crt
    gold1_client.crt
    mac1_client.crt

On the second server in pool "polo":
certificate_store/
    polo.pem
    polo2_client.pem

    polo.crt
    gold.crt
    mac.crt
    polo1_client.crt
    polo2_client.crt
    polo3_client.crt
    polo4_client.crt
    polo5_client.crt
    gold1_client.crt
    mac1_client.crt

and so on in polo - on server gold:
certificate_store/
    gold.pem
    gold1_client.pem

    gold.crt
    polo.crt
    mac.crt
    polo1_client.crt
    polo2_client.crt
    polo3_client.crt
    polo4_client.crt
    polo5_client.crt
    gold1_client.crt
    mac1_client.crt

An on mac:
certificate_store/
    mac.pem
    mac1_client.pem

    gold.crt
    polo.crt
    mac.crt
    polo1_client.crt
    polo2_client.crt
    polo3_client.crt
    polo4_client.crt
    polo5_client.crt
    gold1_client.crt
    mac1_client.crt

Note that every server in the scheme has all the public certs, but only the private keys for the pool it is a member of and its own local client key.
Further note: Server keys/certs DO NOT have a number after the name, even in a pool.
              Client keys/certs ALWAYS have a number after the name, even when NOT in a pool.

S3C3 determines the server's pool/client name based on the .pem files. If there are multiple server/client pem files present S3C3 will fall over and die horribly.
