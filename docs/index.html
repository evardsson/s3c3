        <section>
            <p>Before you begin installing you should determine what your S3C3 Scheme will look like.
             Familiarize yourself with the basics of the <a href="#scheme">scheme</a> before beginning.</p>
        </section>
        <a name="requirements"></a>
        <section><h3>Requirements:</h3>
            <p>There are several requirements for S3C3 to run. In bulleted form:
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP 5.3 or later</li>
                    <li><a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http">PECL HTTP</a> support</li>
                    <li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php">PHP OpenSSL</a> support</li>
                    <li>A way to generate and sign certificates with proper usage settings like
                    <a href="http://xca.sourceforge.net/">XCA</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Once you have met all of the requirements and have your certificates ready to go you can copy or move the s3c3
            folder to where the web server will serve it out. Make sure to change the ownership of the files to web server
            user, so it can update configurations when needed.</p>
            <p>You will need 2 more directories where the web server has write privileges, that are outside the usual web
            document space. One is for logging and the other will hold all the certificates. As an example, we will assume I
            have all my certificates and keys ready in the keyexport folder of my home directory:<br />
            <pre class="brush: bash">
sudo mkdir /var/s3c3
sudo mkdir /var/s3c3/certificate
sudo cp ~/keyexport/* /var/s3c3/certificate/
sudo mkdir /var/s3c3/log
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/s3c3
            </pre>
            </p>
            <p>You do not need to worry about the permissions on the certificate store until <em>after</em> you complete the
            installation, at which time you should verify that they are all, indeed 0400.</p>
        </section>
        <a name="configuration"></a>
        <section><h3>Configuration:</h3>
            <p>Configuration in S3C3 is managed first by a YAML file in app/conf/conf.yml and then, if desired, the token and
            scheme configurations can be maintained in the database. Creating the configuration file first will save a whole
            lot of time in terms of installation.</p>
            <p>If you look at the sample configuration file (conf.yml.example) you will see a whole mess of comments. You do
            not need to include the comments in your configuration file; they are there to help you initially set it up.</p>
            <p>The configuration file is broken into 7 sections. Each of them are explained in detail here.</p>
            <section>

                    determines where the application looks for the scheme configuration and token settings. Setting this value
                    to <code>db</code> does not mean you will no longer need the conf.yml file in place!</dd>

                    name must match the listener name with a number added at the end. (See <a href="#schemenames">Scheme Names</a>).</dd>
                    <dt><code>debug.level</code></dt><dd>The debug level. Currently any value over 0 will cause the application to

                <p>There are 3 sections in <code>database</code> with <code>dbmaster</code> and <code>dbslave</code> having
                6 subsections each. If your deployment does not use a master-slave replication you can use the same values
                for both, otherwise the application will use the values in <code>dbmaster</code> for read-write connections 
                and those in <code>dbslave</code> for read-only connections.</p>

        <section><h3>Calling Bootstrap:</h3>
            <p>Now, you have your conf.yml file, what to do? You have a couple choices: you can (a) let the bootstrap module
            load the conf.yml to its proper location, or (b) copy the conf.yml file to s3c3/app/conf/conf.yml, change
            ownership of the file to the web server user and then call the bootstrap module to finalize the installation.</p>
            <p>Method (a) first: we will assume that the S3C3 app is installed in /var/www/s3c3 and that the conf.yml file
            you just completed is sitting in /tmp/conf.yml</p>
            <pre class="brush: bash">
cd /var/www/s3c3
sudo php bootstrap/bootstrap.php -af /tmp/conf.yml
            </pre>
            <p>That's all it takes. The flag <code>-a</code> tells the bootstrap module to run on "autopilot" and the flag
            <code>-f</code> tells the bootstrap module to load the configuration file from the filepath that follows the
            flag. Note that you can combine flags, as in the example with only one '-'.</p>
            <p>The only other flag available to the bootstrap module is <code>-c</code> which tells it to try and run in
            color for xterm or similar. (This will not work in DOS, sorry). This comes in handy for the next method.</p>
            <p>Method (b): again we will assume that the S3C3 app is installed in /var/www/s3c3 and that the conf.yml file
            you just completed is sitting in /tmp/conf.yml. Further, we will assume that the web server username is
            www-data.</p>
            <pre class="brush: bash">
cd /var/www/s3c3
sudo mv /tmp/conf.yml /var/www/s3c3/app/conf/
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/s3c3/app/conf/conf.yml
sudo php bootstrap/bootstrap.php -c
            </pre>
            <p>This will now start the bootstrap module and it will ask 'Conf.yml already exists, would you like the update
            menu? (Y/N)'.<br />

            Answer Y (hit Enter, Y is the default) and you will get a menu that looks like:<br />

            Answer W and hit Enter and the bootstrap module will do all the same writing and saving that it does in method (a).</p>

        <section><h3>Scheme Names:</h3>
            <p>In this scheme there are 3 listeners (polo, gold and mac) and 5 clients (polo1, polo2, polo3, gold1 and mac1).
            Note that <em>all</em> client names <em>must</em> end with a number (even if there is only one client for a pool) and all
            listener names <em>must not</em> end with a number.</p>
            <p>The names of the listeners/pools and clients do not have to reflect the hostnames or urls of the machines.
            They certainly can, but it is not a requirement. When a listener is responding to a client it is using the
            built-in capabilities of HTTP to do so, and so does not require to know the client's url.</p>
            <p>When a client is looking for the url for a specific listener it calls the configuration to find it.</p>
        </section>
        <a name="listeners"></a>
        <section><h3>Listeners and Pools:</h3>
            <p>The 3 listeners in the sample scheme are polo, gold and mac. The listener at gold is related to single machine,
            as is the listener at mac. Looking at the polo listener, however, there are 3 machines that are tied to the same
            listener. What makes this possible is the sharing of the listener key (polo.pem) for polo with all 3 machines in
            the pool, while each has its own client key (polo1.pem at polo1, for example).</p>
        </section>
        <a name="clients"></a>
        <section><h3>Clients:</h3>
            <p>Each client has its own, unique private client key, and all the servers in the scheme should have a copy of
            its public key. So for the mac1 client, it has a copy of mac1.pem in the certificate store, while all the other
            machines have a copy of mac1.crt in their certificate stores.</p>
            <p>Although every client name must end in a number, it does not need to fill out a strict counting order. If we
            had wanted to we could have named gold1 as gold7 with no problems.</p>

            <p>Certificate handling in S3C3 is core to making the system work, and is very closely tied to the S3C3 Scheme
            and its naming conventions.</p>
        </section>
        <a name="certnaming"></a>
        <section><h3>Naming Certificates:</h3>
            <p>In S3C3 public key SSL certificates are referred to as certificates or certs, while private keys are referred
            to as keys. All certificates and keys used with S3C3 <em>must</em> stored in the .pem format, with public SSL
            certificates saved with a .crt extension and private keys saved with a .pem extension.</p>
            <p>The names of certificates and keys must match their targets. So the key for the polo listener pool would be
            polo.pem, and the certificate for the same pool would be polo.crt. Likewise, the key for the mac1 client would be
            mac1.pem and the certificate would be mac1.crt.</p>
            <p>The only exception to this rule is the root signing certificate, which must be named as XXX_root.crt or
            XXX_ca.crt or XXX.ca.crt - where XXX can be replaced with any ascii string. In the unittests the name of the root
            certificate is s3c3_root.crt.</p>
        </section>
        <a name="signing"></a>
        <section><h3>Signing Certificates:</h3>
            <p>In order to ensure that clients are who they claim to be, all certificates used in S3C3 must be signed by the
            known root certificate. If you don't wish to do this from the command line I recommend
            <a href="http://xca.sourceforge.net/">XCA</a>.

                <h4>9: Remove Certificate</h4>
                <p>Select 9 from the menu to select a certificate to remove. You will get a list of certificates in the store
                and you can select one by the number next to it. This <em>does not</em> include private keys or the root
                certificate. Those must be managed manually.</p>
                <h4>8: Add Certificate</h4>
                <p>Select 8 from the menu to add a certificate to the store and follow the prompts. You must ensure that
                client certificates are valid client certificates and server certificates are valid server certificates. You
                cannot overwrite a certificate for a client or server already in the store. (And now you know why I put the
                instructions for 9 before 8).</p>

            <p>Each of the first 7 items in the menu corresponds to a section in the configuration file. Select one of the
            sections and you will first be shown the current configuration and asked if you wish to edit it. If you select Y
            the bootstrap module will step you through each item in that section to update it, show you the results and ask
            again if you wish to edit it. If you are happy with how it looks enter N and you will be taken back to the main
            menu. In order to save your changes select W to write them out before closing, or if you have made no changes you
            can select X to exit.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The sample shims for Client and Listener are in the s3c3/examples directory. The example is a very simple
            command-line script that offers a small menu. The example can be run by:</p>
            <pre class="brush: bash">
cd /var/www/s3c3
sudo php examples/example.php
            </pre>
            <p>The output of one of the test runs looks like:<br />First we select a listener by typing 'S' and hitting enter</p>
            <pre>
S3C3 Example Menu

S:  Select Listener
G:  Generate Requests
X:  Exit
Please select an action from the menu above > s
0:  polo
1:  gold
2:  mac
X:  Cancel and go back
Please select a listener from the list above > 2
            </pre>
            <p>After selecting the listener the menu refreshes and shows us the selected listener. Now we choose to generate 'G'.</p>
            <pre>
S3C3 Example Menu

S:  Select Listener (mac)
G:  Generate Requests
X:  Exit
Please select an action from the menu above > g
How many requests would you like to generate? [1 - 10] > 5
Generate requests with errors? (Y/N) [N] > y
            </pre>
            <p>The example will take some time to generate the requests, get the initial token and then send the requests and
            display the results after all requests have completed. (Note that the example does not completely conform to the
            SRS, in that the listener is not stripping the password from the results. This change was made in order to verify
            that all the fields being recieved by the listener were received exactly as sent.)</p>
